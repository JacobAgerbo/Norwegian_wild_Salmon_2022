# Hologenomics reveal co-evolution of an intestinal Mycoplasma and its salmonid host
This Github repository includes the analytical framework to generate results that are reported in Rasmunssen et al. 2022 (unpublished) and are central to its main claims.

#Analytical Background

• For a more evolutionary perspective, we investigated SNVs, SCVs, and SAAVs of NWS_MAG_00006 (aka. *Candidatus* Mycoplasma salmoninae salar), following the wonderful anvi’o guidelines
    - SNVs were used to investigate potential mutations being related to host genotype (actual hologenomics)
    - SCVs were applied for pNpS inferring to look for gene wise selection pressure
    - SAAVs were used to investigate fixated mutations in the amino acid composition within populations of metagenomes

• SAAVs were used to make a prevalence analysis across host genotypes within Norwegian individuals
    - SAAVs were analysed in concordance with predicted protein structures used for SNV analysis

## Analysis

**First of all - I’m a massive anvi’o fanboy, thank you so much for the amazing platform**
All of these analyses have been made through anvi’o, since it works smoothly and are super user friendly,
so if you don’t used anvi’o yet, then get sh*t together :+1:
